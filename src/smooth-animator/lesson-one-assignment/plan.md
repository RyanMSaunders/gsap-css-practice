I want to create an animation using the Aug 28th CSS battle,
WHere there square in the inside moves across the screen
and bounces against the walls
and upon each bounce, a different property is animated using a different ease

I want to set the position randomly every cycle
Maybe even create conditional statements for identifying the four corners:
If ball moves to top left quadrant, Placement/space changes (various placement related properties)
If top right quadrant, Size/Shape changes (various size/shape related properties)
If bottom left, Colour/Contrast changes
If bottom right, Texture changes

Steps:
Learn how to use GSAP timeline
See if you can get a square to randomly bounce off corners
